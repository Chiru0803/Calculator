# Calculator

A Calculator in Python is a simple application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It takes user input for numbers and operators and then calculates the result based on the chosen operation.

The calculator prompts the user to enter numerical values and choose an operator for the desired arithmetic operation.
The user can enter numbers and operators using either the command line or a graphical user interface (GUI).

The basic arithmetic operations supported by the calculator include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
More advanced calculators may support additional operations like exponentiation, square root, etc.

The calculator should handle input errors gracefully, such as invalid characters, division by zero, or incomplete expressions.

Once the user provides the input, the calculator evaluates the expression and computes the result using Python's built-in mathematical functions and operators.

The calculated result is displayed to the user, either in the command line or a GUI window, depending on the implementation.
